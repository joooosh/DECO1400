						<h3>John and Katy</h3>
						<div>
							<img src="images/1.jpg" alt="photo of John and Katy">
							<p>Two inseparable friends, John and Katy, met with an accident on their way to Boston City. The following morning, Jason woke up blind and Sam was still unconscious. Dr. Berkeley was standing at his bedside looking at his health chart and medications with a thoughtful expression on his face. When he saw Sam awake, he beamed at him and asked." How are you feeling today Sam?" Sam tried to put up a brave face and smiled back saying, "absolutely wonderful Doctor. I am very grateful for all that you have done for me. "Dr Berkeley was moved at Sam's deed. All that he could say was, "You are a very brave man Sam and God will make it up to you in one way or another". While he was moving on to the next patient, Sam called back at him almost pleading, "promise me you won't tell Jason anything".
								"You know I won't do that. Trust me." and walked away.
								"Thank you " whispered Sam. He smiled and looked up in prayer " I hope I live up to your ideas...please give me the strength to be able to go through this..Amen"
							</p>
							<p>Months later when Jason had recuperated considerably, he stopped hanging around with Sam. He felt discouraged and embarrassed to spend time with a disabled person like Sam.
							</p>
							<p>Sam was lonely and disheartened ,since he didn't have any body else other than Jason to count on. Things went from bad to worse. And one day Sam died in despair. When Jason was called on his burial, he found a letter waiting for him. Dr Berkeley gave it to him with an expressionless face and said" This is for you Jason. Sam had asked me to give it to you when he was gone".

					<h3>Me and little Amy</h3>
					<div>
						<img src="images/2.jpg" alt="photo of Amy and Suan" >
						<p>There was a time when Amy didn't have a lot of friends. She was a bit shy and reserved. She never really wanted to be popular, but she did want to have someone to share secrets and laughs with. All through high school, though, she just slipped in and out of "light" friendships where she didn't find a lot of comfort or companionship.	
						</p>
						<p>When it came time to go to college, Whitney was quite nervous. She was going to be rooming with someone she didn't know and living in a town 300 miles away from home. There wouldn't be a single person she knew in town. She had no idea how she was going to make friends in this new environment.
						</p>
						<p>The first week of classes, something happened that changed Whitney's life forever. In her English Composition class, she was asked (as were all the students) to share a little about herself. She told everyone where she called home and all of the other ordinary details that students share in such situations. The final question for each student was always the same: "What is your goal for this class?" Now, most of the students said it was to get a good grade, pass the class or something similar, but for some reason, Whitney said something entirely different. She said that her goal was to make just one good friend.

					<h3>I'll never forget</h3>

						<img src="images/3.jpg" alt="photo of Peter and Lilian">
						<p>They were about 40 in all…. third standard boys and girls from a class posing shoulder to shoulder for an annual photo session from a public school in the capital city of Delhi : a small child in the 3rd row, second from the left…stands out…Ravi is the only dark guy in the whole class…ya that’s me!
						</p>
						<p>This picture took me back to the time when I joined the school…..i loved to go to this school and my parents had fulfilled that wish for me. Had lots of excitement and thoughts about my school life…but things didn’t go the way I thought.
						</p>
						<p>I had completed three years in the school but didn’t have a good friend in the entire school…..everyone always stayed away from me….i was black! None of us in our age were aware about the racism and color discrimination….but just followed what they have been seeing and learning from others. We never played together.
						</p>
						<p>In the classroom, no one sits next to me…..I was just alone in the whole desk…it hurt me a lot but had to live with it… I worked harder and harder to create a space for me….but eventually I was never appreciated by the teachers even. I just thought that’s the way world is supposed to be.

					<h3>My happiest time</h3>
					<div>
					
						<img src="images/5.jpg" alt="photo of Ashey and Dean" >
						<p>Life is a path through which you reach to the destination of success. In this path there are many hurdles, twists and turns. To reach the destination there comes a crucial turn in the path which shapes one’s life. This turn gives the right direction to reach the destination of success. This is nothing but the turning point of life.This point comes in everybody’s life because Everybody walk on the same path but it differs from individual to individual and success comes to  those only who choose  right turn to reach the destination. Some  recognize it earlier , some later and many do not in their whole life.
						</p>
						<p>Divas and Piyush are very good friends since their college. They both studied in the nationally recognized college. It was almost guaranteed that every student would have a job after the college. But It did not happen. After the college except Divas everybody in their circle was placed . Divas was sad and Piyush was Equally sad for Divas. They were sad not only because Divas was not placed but also because they were going far from each other. They understood it well that true friends are rare.  Piyush was spending his maximum time with Divas because he knew that Divas needs him. Next day  Piyush had to go Banglore for the joining so he decided that Tonight he and Divas will sit together for beer on the tank of the college .
						</p>
						<p>Piyush brought two Kingfisher .Both of them opened bottles and cheered. Divas was pretending to be happy because he did not want to look sad in front of Piyush after all it was the happiest day of his life. But he couldn’t  say anything because a mixture of emotions was charging at him. Piyush understood the situation and finally broke the ice.

					<h3>A friendship lasts forever</h3>
					<div>
				
						<img src="images/6.jpg" alt="photo of Dexter and Diesel">
						<p>“Hey class, I could hear the noise from the other class. The fact that there isn’t any teacher in your class doesn’t give you the audacity to make unnecessary noise. Henceforth, class prefect, write down the names of all the `talkatives`. I will be back after my lesson with the form three class”.
						</p>
						<p>Mr. Ackom, who was the English teacher, wore a yellowish-brown corduroy trousers with a v-neck striped blue t-shirt. He topped it with a pair of buckled brown shoes. Because he was seething with anger, he stomped out of the form two class. The class became dead mute for a while. The noise resurfaced after five minutes with an unmatched crescendo.
						</p>
						<p>My last school was less privileged. Because, we had only two teachers for the whole school- Sir Abass and the head teacher, Mr. Klango. Other learning and teaching facilities such as text books ,blackboard, desks were also not available.This made the pupils to prattle and rattle vernacular with unimaginable, unabashed and inordinate relish. This plight made it difficult for me to understand certain simple English words. I got up from my desk and walked to Sammy`s desk to ingratiate myself with him to write down my name.I thought those whose names were written down were the well-behaved ones. Sammy looked at me with disdain and condescension. I returned to my seat with heavy head.

					<h3>Lily and Tracy</h3>
					<div>
				
						<img src="images/7.jpg" alt="photo of Nick and Hazel">
						<p>When I was at CALO, ” Change Academy Lake of Ozarks” I met a girl and her name was Adriana. She was very nice to me and she was very supportive when it comes to helping someone emotionally even though she was struggling herself.
						</p>
						<p>After we both left from the program. I went back to North Carolina and Adriana went home which was New York. I eventually moved to New York and reconnected with her. I went to see her when i had the money and she came visit me when she had money. Every time I went to see her, while walking at white plains or near Crest wood, Teens from her school would make fun of her and call her names. Basically they were bulling her. She tried to fit in but no one really excepted her. People were so mean, they would call her a boy.
						</p>
						<p>One time Marcus called me while i was in the middle of something, He told me that one girl punched him in a lip. So i took the train to Crest-wood and taught the girl a lesson. She should of picked on her own size. I basically told the girl if you touch Marcus you have to go through me. I am tired of  people disrespect my friend. Instead of trying to be popular and pick on people who are not popular, put your self on their shoes and see how would you feel if someone made fun of you. I am sure that you wont like it. All I want in this world is for teens to grow up and act like an adult. Today Marcus and I are still friends. I don’t care  How he dress  I except  who he is and i value our friendship.
